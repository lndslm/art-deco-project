            <h3>The Art of Art Deco</h3>
            <p>
              Art Deco, short for the French Arts Décoratifs, and sometimes
              referred to simply as Deco, is a style of visual arts,
              architecture, and product design, that first appeared in France in
              the 1910s (just before World War I), and flourished in the United
              States and Europe during the 1920s to early 1930s. Through styling
              and design of the exterior and interior of anything from large
              structures to small objects, including how people look (clothing,
              fashion and jewelry), Art Deco has influenced bridges, buildings
              (from skyscrapers to cinemas), ships, ocean liners, trains, cars,
              trucks, buses, furniture, and everyday objects like radios and
              vacuum cleaners.
            </p>
            <p>
              Art Deco combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich
              materials. During its heyday, it represented luxury, glamour,
              exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. The
              Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and other skyscrapers of
              New York City built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments to
              the style.

              <h4>Tamara De Lempicka</h4>
              <h5>- The Baroness with a Brush -</h5>
              <p>
                Polish artist Tamara de Lempicka is possibly one of the most
                admired and most recognizable Art Deco artists. Lempicka became
                engaged in the bohemian lifestyle of 1920s Parisian socialites,
                painting portraits of many prominent figures including the
                exiled nobility, which brought the painter critical acclaim,
                fame, and considerable wealth. Her artistry is a perfect
                representation of her lifestyle of glamour. Drawing inspiration
                from the popular painting movements of the time like cubism, she
                developed her unique approach, elegant, precise and clean. The
                bold bright colors and angular style that came to dominate her
                work, as the main features of Art Deco style, are among the main
                reasons why her oeuvre is seen as the best representative of Art
                Deco painting.

              <h4>Le Corbusier</h4>
              <h5>- The Man Behind the Art Deco Term -</h5>
              <p>
                Although he was one of the loudest opponents of decorative arts,
                the architect Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris, better known as Le
                Corbusier became inseparable from the Art Deco context over the
                years. The first use of the term Art Deco is often attributed to
                this man, even though the term officially entered the art
                history vocabulary in the sixties. In 1925, at the inaugural Art
                Deco exhibition, Le Corbusier’s pavilion stood in opposition to
                the extravagant decorative motifs typical for the new style.
                Already an idol in the history of architecture, Le Corbusier
                favored standardized housing, purist aesthetics, strict and
                rational designs. Le Corbusier’s architectural works were
                anti-decorative and hostile towards the luxurious, expensive and
                exotic materials promoted by Art Deco artists.

              <h4>Sonia Delaunay</h4>
              <h5>- Abstract Fashion Pioneer -</h5>
              <p>
                Russian-born French artist Sonia Delaunay is among those Art
                Deco designers who even today strongly influence fashion trends.
                Inspired by Cubism, Fauvism and working closely with Surrealist
                poetry school and Dada artists, she was the first designer to
                introduce abstract inspiration into the world of fashion. Her
                bold combinations of colors and textiles brought her the title
                of the designer of modern fashions during the 1925 Art Deco
                Exposition in Paris and she became famous for her patchwork
                dresses. In the 1920s her collaboration with Dadaist artists
                resulted in the creation of her “poem dresses” where geometric
                blocks of colors were placed next to the lines of poetry. As one
                of the most important Art Deco artists, her abstract designs
                influence today high-end fashion collections.
