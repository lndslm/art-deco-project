            <h3>The Art of Art Deco</h3>
            <p>
              Art Deco, short for the French Arts DÃ©coratifs, and sometimes
              referred to simply as Deco, is a style of visual arts,
              architecture, and product design, that first appeared in France in
              the 1910s (just before World War I), and flourished in the United
              States and Europe during the 1920s to early 1930s. Through styling
              and design of the exterior and interior of anything from large
              structures to small objects, including how people look (clothing,
              fashion and jewelry), Art Deco has influenced bridges, buildings
              (from skyscrapers to cinemas), ships, ocean liners, trains, cars,
              trucks, buses, furniture, and everyday objects like radios and
              vacuum cleaners.
            </p>
            <p>
              Art Deco combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich
              materials. During its heyday, it represented luxury, glamour,
              exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. The
              Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and other skyscrapers of
              New York City built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments to
              the style.
